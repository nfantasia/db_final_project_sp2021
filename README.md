## Intended Users
Some typical users that would use this solution would be music sharing and streaming platforms such as Spotify and Apple Music. This solution would be helpful for them to organize the enormous number of artists publishing their work to the respective streaming platforms. When an artist releases a brand-new album, this solution can be used to make a record of the information about the album as well as the tracks contained within the album. Not only does the music database organize the streaming platform’s architecture, but it also allows customers and music fans to easily find and access the music they want to listen to with little difficulty. Fans can look up different albums by artists they love and learn new things about the artists in general as well as their large collection of albums/tracks. Fans could utilize the database in a similar way to the music streaming platforms with respect to their own collection of music. Additionally, disc jockeys at a radio station must be able to benefit in a similar fashion. A disc jockey must be able to find the music he/she wants to play and do it quickly, so having a database of various artists and their albums/tracks allows for the disc jockeys to access the music they intend to play on the radio.

## Domain objects
There are two domain objects implemented in this solution. One is “albums”, which maintains a many-to-one relationship with the “artists” model. The other one is “tracks”, which maintains a many-to-one relationship with the “albums” model. This can be taken as one artist can have numerous albums, and in each of the albums, there could be several tracks. Because of these relationships, the team has included a foreign key attribute in each of the domain objects. The foreign key in albums references the primary key in artists, and the foreign key in tracks references the primary key in albums. In addition, albums contains the following attributes: album name, release date, and number of songs. Tracks contain the track title, length, and genre.
